# SilkroadBot</br>
<b> Overview </b></br>
I initially started this project because I was obsessed with playing the game so called Silkroad.</br>
This project is one of my best projects ever, it took me hell a lot of time to get to this point at which it actually works pretty</br> well.</br>
To begin with, I didn't know much about networking or intercepting connections between servers and clients, so I had to learn a lot</br> about networking and actually using this knowledge with C# as I was good with this language at that time.</br>
So basically what this program does is that it's like a proxy. It redirects the game to it's listening server and receives the</br> connection from the server as if it was the game itself, making it able to send false info to the server so as for example to request</br> the movement of the player without the need to physically moving the mouse or so.</br>
I first thought of using AutoIT but then i realised that networking is a much more professional way to do it, also i needed some experience in the networking field.</br>
</br>
To be honest, this is a VERY VERY hard project so i used some code from other projects ( knowing what the codes does of course ) those other projects were open source and i dont really remember their names so if you see parts of your code inside my app and you want to take credits for it you can contact me through my email: tarek55544@Live.com , I would be very happy to put your name in my project.</br>
</br>
This was a proof that any MMORPG can be automated using a proxy or a program like this one. I'm pretty sure there are many other projects that are way better than this one, but hey, I coded this when I was 15 years old. Plus, I'm pretty sure other projects aren't open source like this one.</br>
</br>
<b> What Is impleomented in this project</b></br>
-> Login (which was the hardest part as Silkroad used encryption and PIN code confirmation which took me a lot of time to figure out)</br>
-> Sending a movement packet</br>
-> Automatically restart the game when something wrong happens and the game crashes for some reason. </br>
-> Logging the packets sent and received between the game and the server to help better understand how the game works and maybe</br> implement automated features for other stuff like attacking and buying stuff ingame.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<b> Possible Improvements </b></br>
-> Actually complete the project ( add features like automatic attacking ,using spells, buying stuff from merchants,... etc )</br>
-> Implement a user-friendly design???</br>
</br>
</br>
<b> Reasons I stopped from completing this project </b></br>
-> VERY TIME COMSUMING</br>
-> Silkroad is dead</br>
-> I had already proven the concept and further work would be classified as implementation of simple features that any developer can do. </br>
